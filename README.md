Phishing attacks pose a significant and ongoing threat to online security. To
counter these attacks, machine learning techniques have proven useful. These methods are not
always reliable because phishing URLs can closely resemble legitimate ones, making them hard
to differentiate, and sometimes even some advanced Machine learning techniques fail. This
study proposes a novel approach that combines techniques of deep learning (DL) to enhance
phishing detection. Deep learning algorithms are better in identifying patterns in data. We assess
our approach using a dataset that contains phishing URLs and demonstrate that our method
achieves improved accuracy in identifying phishing URLs. Our approach is also effective in
detecting new and previously unknown phishing URLs.
